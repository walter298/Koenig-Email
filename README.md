**Summary**

This is a very simple C++ SMTP Client library, wrapped around libcurl. You construct ```Email``` objects, storing parameters such as the server name, sender email, and recipients as data members. Once the necessary parameters have been set, you call ```send``` to send the email. ```send``` parses all the members into a properly formatted email message, and then sends it using TLS encryption. You can resend an email and/or change its parameters. 

**Motivation**

I can't find a single other C++ library that sends email and is actually easy to use. Libcurl is fantastic but is quite low level. VMime is complex, not trivial to set up (at least on Windows), and is not compatible with post C++14 versions. POCO is aggressively boilerplate-OOP style. I wanted a modern, simple, understandable library where you can send email as easily as you could in Python. 

**Requirements to Set Up**
1. Libcurl should be linked
2. A working C++20 Compiler and Standard Library

**Current Capabilities**
Emails can contain plain text or embedded HTML. You can't yet add attachments. 

**Example**

```cpp

#include <iostream>

#include "smtp.h"

int main(void) {
    //globally initializes libcurl in constructor and quits libcurl in destructor. 
    koenig::Instance instance;

    koenig::Email email;
    email.serverURL = "smtp://smtp.gmail.com:587";
    email.sender = "ken@gmail.com";
    email.password = "my_app_password";
    email.certPath = "cacert.pem";
    email.recipients = { "robert@yahoo.com", "jim@gmail.com", "sarah@gmail.com" };
    email.ccRecipients = { "walter@gmail.com" };
    email.subject = "Example Email";
    email.body = "It seems you've been living two lives";
    email.embedHTML("html_ex.html");
    auto res = email.send(false); //default argument is true if you want debug information to be printed 

    if (!res) {
        std::cerr << res.what() << '\n';
    }

    return 0;
}
```
